To do:
- Make sure favicon works when operating from the Github server
- Make it so web content is on top of video
		- Maybe make video a little opaque so that it doesn't detract from web navigability?
- Make the navbar prettier
- Make all the text prettier (both in color and font)
- Make it so the header doesn't change when you run your mouse over it
